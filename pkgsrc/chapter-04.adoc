==  4.2. Bootstrapping pkgsrc

pkgsrc can be bootstrapped for use in two different modes: privileged and unprivileged one. In unprivileged mode in contrast to privileged one all programs are installed under one particular user and cannot utilise privileged operations (packages don't create special users and all special file permissions like setuid are ignored).

Installing the bootstrap kit from source should be as simple as:

    # env CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot checkout -P pkgsrc
    # cd pkgsrc/bootstrap
    # ./bootstrap
    

To bootstrap in unprivileged mode pass “--unprivileged” flag to **bootstrap**

By default, in privileged mode pkgsrc uses ``/usr/pkg`` for __prefix__ where programs will be installed in, and ``/usr/pkg/pkgdb`` for the package database directory where pkgsrc will do its internal bookkeeping,``/var`` is used as __varbase__,where packages install their persistent data. In unprivileged mode pkgsrc uses ``~/pkg`` for __prefix__, ``~/pkg/pkgdb`` for the package database, and ``~/pkg/var`` for __varbase__.

You can change default layout using command-line arguments. Run “./bootstrap --help” to get details.

[NOTE]
===============================
The bootstrap installs a **bmake** tool. Use this **bmake** when building via pkgsrc. For examples in this guide, use **bmake** instead of “make”.
===============================


[NOTE]
===============================
It is possible to bootstrap multiple instances of pkgsrc using non-intersecting directories. Use **bmake** corresponding to the installation you're working with to build and install packages.
