=  Chapter 9. Directory layout of the installed files

The files that are installed by pkgsrc are organized in a way that
is similar to what you find in the ``/usr`` directory of the base system. But some details are different. This is because pkgsrc initially came from FreeBSD and had adopted its file system hierarchy. Later it was largely influenced by NetBSD. But no matter which operating system you are using pkgsrc with, you can expect the same layout for pkgsrc.

There are mainly four root directories for pkgsrc, which are all configurable in the ``bootstrap/bootstrap`` script. When pkgsrc has been installed as root, the default locations are:

    LOCALBASE=              /usr/pkg
    PKG_SYSCONFBASE=        /usr/pkg/etc
    VARBASE=                /var
    PKG_DBDIR=              /usr/pkg/pkgdb
    
In unprivileged mode (when pkgsrc has been installed as any other user), the default locations are:

    LOCALBASE=              ${HOME}/pkg
    PKG_SYSCONFBASE=        ${HOME}/pkg/etc
    VARBASE=                ${HOME}/pkg/var
    PKG_DBDIR=              ${HOME}/pkg/pkgdb
    
What these four directories are for, and what they look like is explained below.

*   ``LOCALBASE`` corresponds to the ``/usr`` directory in the base system. It is the “main” directory where the files are installed and contains the well-known subdirectories like ``bin``, ``include``, ``lib``,
``share`` and ``sbin``.

*   ``VARBASE`` corresponds to ``/var`` in the base system. Some programs (especially games, network daemons) need write access to it during normal
operation.

*   ``PKG_SYSCONFDIR`` corresponds to ``/etc`` in the base system. It contains configuration files of the packages, as well as pkgsrc's https://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/configuring.html#mk.conf[``mk.conf``]
itself.

==  9.1. File system layout in ${LOCALBASE} 

The following directories exist in a typical pkgsrc installation in ``${LOCALBASE}``.

``bin`` Contains executable programs that are intended to be directly used by the end user.

``emul`` Contains files for the emulation layers of various other operating systems, especially for NetBSD.

``etc`` (the usual location of ``${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}``) Contains the configuration files.

``include`` Contains headers for the C and C++ programming languages.

``info`` Contains GNU info files of various packages.

``lib`` Contains shared and static libraries.

``libdata`` Contains data files that don't change after installation. Other data files belong into ``${VARBASE}``.

``libexec`` Contains programs that are not intended to be used by end users, such as helper programs or network daemons.

``libexec/cgi-bin`` Contains programs that are intended to be executed as
CGI scripts by a web server.

``man`` (the usual value of ``${PKGMANDIR}``) Contains brief documentation in form of manual pages.

``sbin`` Contains programs that are intended to be used only by the super-user.

``share`` Contains platform-independent data files that don' change after installation.

``share/doc`` Contains documentation files provided by the packages.

``share/examples`` Contains example files provided by the packages. Among others, the original configuration files are saved here and copied to ``${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}`` during installation.

``share/examples/rc.d`` Contains the original files for rc.d scripts.

``var`` (the usual location of ``${VARBASE}``) Contains files that may be modified after installation.

==  9.2. File system layout in ${VARBASE} 

``db/pkg`` (the usual location of ``${PKG_DBDIR}``) Contains information about the currently installed packages.

``games`` Contains highscore files.

``log`` Contains log files.

``run`` Contains informational files about daemons that are currently running.
